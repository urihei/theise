\chapter{Results}
\ignore{
In this chapter I present the research papers that display the results  of this thesis. The chapter is organized as follows:
Sections \ref{sec:dcc}, \ref{sec:dcbn}, and \ref{sec:disco} address various problems related to learning from marginals. Specifically,  \secref{sec:dcc} deals with the problem of robust learning from discrete  marginals in a minimax, assumption-free setting. In Sections \ref{sec:dcbn} and \ref{sec:disco} I present novel frameworks for learning based on continuous marginals and copula functions. Finally, in \secref{sec:lex} I explore a different notion of robustness, and present the problem of robustly learning experts for online sequence prediction.
