This work include 3 papers I will now describe my contribution in echo one of them.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The first paper, ``What cannot be learned with Bethe approximations'', was written by my advisor Amir Globerson and myself.
  Under supervision of my advisor, I came up with the idea for the paper, proved the theoretical results and performed the experiments.
  The paper was published in the proceedings of the 27th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2011, Barcelona, Spain
\item
  The second paper, ``Inferning with high girth graphical models'', was written by my advisor Amir Globerson and myself.
  Under supervision of my advisor, I came up with the idea for the paper, proved the theoretical results and preformed the experiments.
  The paper was published in the proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2014, Beijing, China
\item
  The third paper, ``Improper Deep Kernels'', was written by my advisor Amir Globerson, Roi Livni, Elad Eban, Gal Elidan and myself.
  The initial idea was suggested by Elad Eban, proof of the sample complexity bounds was done by Roi Livni, while the development of the new kernel and the experiments were performed by me under the supervision of Gal Elidan and my advisor.
  The paper was published in proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, AISTATS 2016, Cadiz, Spain.
